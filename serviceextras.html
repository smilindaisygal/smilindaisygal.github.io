                   <h4>Big Box Bike Safety Check</h4>
                   <p>Roughly 75% of bikes purchased at Big Box Retailers fail basic safety checks due
                      to assembly errors. Even if there aren't outright safety issues, poor assembly
                      can mean missed shifting drivetrains, under-inflated tires, loose headsets,
                      wheels that are improperly tensioned and prone to damage, and other problems that
                      will shorten bicycles lifespan and make them unsafe to ride. Our certified techs
                      are happy to do a thorough safety check.</p>

                   <h4>Bike Overhaul</h4> 
                   <p>Overhaul price varies, based on a number of factors – condition, age, brand/model,
                      and type/brand of replacement parts. Labor charge for this service is typically
                      within the following ranges:<br>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Kids/youth bike (geared)-$120-180</li>
                         <li>Adult rigid bike-$160-320</li>
                         <li>Suspension bike-$200-400</li>
                     </ul><br>

                     Price of parts will depend on what is required and the brand. We always strive to
                     find parts of the highest quality at the most affordable price.
