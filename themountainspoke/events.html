          <h3>Cycle the Continental Divide</h3> 
           <img class="easy1" src="images/ccdivide.jpg" alt="riders on the Continental Divide" width="308" height="213">
          <h4>The Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (GDMBR) is the most recognized and important off-pavement cycling route in the United States, 
            if not the world. The route crisscrosses the Continental Divide from north to south starting in Banff, Alberta, Canada and finishing
             at the US/Mexico border in Antelope Wells, New Mexico.</h4>  
           <ul>
             <li class="dots">Who: Any determined cyclist may challenge the Great Divide Route at any time, in either direction, to qualify for the Tour Divide
                (TD) General Classification (GC).</li><br>
              <img class="skilled" src="images/ccdivide2.jpg" alt="riders on the Continental Divide" width="308" height="213">
              <img class="easy" src="images/ccdivide3.jpg" alt="riders on the Continental Divide" width="308" height="213">
             <li class="dots">When:  All summer long...however, an informal common start date known as the 'grand depart' traditionally kicks off the season 
               2nd week of June from both termini.</li><br>
             <li class="dots">Spirit: Above all, attempts are intended to be solo / self-supported, self-timed, and observed as one stage, i.e. the clock 
               runs non-stop. The challenge is complete upon arrival to the opposite GDMBR terminus from start. There are no required 
               checkpoints or designated rest periods on course. There is no finish time cut-off, however, current convention considers a
                competitive Divide Route finish time as approximately 1.5 times (x) course records. Currently this = 25days (~110 mi/day) for
                 men, and 29.5 days (93 mi/day) for women.</li><br> 
             <li class="dots">Modus operandi: To complete the Route, a rider may resupply food / equipment, rent a room, launder clothing, even service their
                bike at commercial shops along the way. The intent is to ride unsupported between towns, and function self-supported when in towns.
                Any services utilized must always be commercially available to all challengers and not pre-arranged[1]. No private resupply, no
                private lodging.<br>Tour Divide strives for equal opportunity within the GC. Whether doing an independent time trial or tackling the grand départ, 
                TD requires that every challenger—from those living along the route to those living on other continents—have an equal playing field. 
                Therefore, outside assistance[2] with navigation, lodging or resupply (especially receipt of supplies from a non-commercial shipper) 
                is prohibited. Visitation: Divide racing is not intended to be a spectator sport! However, route-town locals only may interact with
                 (i.e. visit briefly, cheer on) thru-racers as they pass through their locale. Out-of-town visitation to the GDMBR mid-race from 
                 challengers' family or friends—even if only a  'loosely-planned', remote possibility for rider rendezvous—is prohibited. 
                 </li><br>
              <li class="dots">TD Route: Aside from the 4 permitted deviations listed below, challengers must always ride 100% of the Great Divide ‘main route’ as denoted by 
                the most current map edition published by ACA. For TD`13, the 2011 printing is still the most current edition. Previous map editions may
                 not be used unless updated with the most current ACA Addenda. Addenda 'sets' are specific to each map printing edition. 
                 *Don't disqualify a perfectly good time trial simply because your maps are outdated and/or you paired them with the wrong addenda.
                  There is a supplemental GPX file of the official TD 'race route' revised annually. Refer to it, even if not navigating by GPS.</li>
