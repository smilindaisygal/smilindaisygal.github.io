            <figcaption class="cap">The Italian brand is best known for its quality road bikes, although it also produces cyclocross, track,
                  mountain and city bikes. Pinarello bikes have been ridden by a number of top pro teams, including Telekom, Banesto,
                   Movistar and Team Sky. They're also British Cycling's bike of choice, according to Bike Radar. Price ranging from $2,500 to
                   $5,125.<br><br><a href="http://www.pinarello.com">pinarello.com</a></figcaption>

            <img class="img"src="images/raleigh.jpg" alt="The Raleigh bicycle, made as ahigh quality commuter bikes" width="250" height="200">
            <figcaption class="cap">Raleigh has an iconic place in cycling history. It made high quality commuter bikes that fit a modest
                 budget. They say that Furley has been popular this year. The frame is made of steel, the seat is a Raleigh Classic Road and the 
                 headset has FSA Integrated Cartridge Bearings.  Bikes range in price from $275 to $690 for comfort bikes, $520 to $1,550 for fitness 
                 bikes, $275 to $1,325 for mountain bikes, and $520 to $2,725 for road bikes, according to Consumer Reports.<br><br>

            <img class="img"src="images/giant.jpg" alt="The Giant Bicycle, made as the best budget bikes" width="250" height="200">
            <figcaption class="cap">This is one of the best budget bike brands, Engay says. It gets high ratings in both the mountain and 
                hybrid bikes categories because of the bikes’ design and features. Cyclists who want a comfortable and confident ride, both
                 on and off the road, consider Giant first. The ATX Lite, for example, is designed as a cyclocross bike, which is stronger
                  than a road bike but not as stable as a mountain bike, and you can use it on various terrains, Nemirovski says. Prices range from
                   $607.99 to $11,905. “And it’s also a good entry-level bike.”<br><br><a href="http://www.giant-bicycles.com">giant-bicycles.com</a></figcaption>

                <img class="img"src="images/felt.jpg" alt="The Felt Bicycle, made to be the best race bike, or just an everyday bike" width="250" height="200">
                <figcaption class="cap">Felt’s goal is to build the best bikes in the world, according to Campus Wheel Works. They say the 
                  bikes feel as if the brand puts the same effort into every one whether it’s a bike for cruising around town, crushing local
                  single track, or setting your personal best at a triathlon. Felt develops every part of every bike down to the littlest 
                  details with in-house engineers, making the bikes as good as they can possibly be.  Prices ranging from $1,785 to $8,999.<br><br>
